## About the documentation

# Authorization

> API Authorization Endpoint

```
http://api.wavecell.com/access/token
```
Wavecell JS SDK requires `access token` to authorize customer applications to the Multichannel Communication System.

To start you must have a `client id` and `client secret`. Wavecell will provide you this credentials.

Once you have your credentials, you can get an `access token` using OAUTH 2.0.

Wavecell supports two OAUTH 2.0 flows:

- Client credentials
- Authorization Code

# WMCSEngine

```javascript
var options = {
  'access_token' : 'your_access_token',
  'uid' : 'unique_user_id',
  'name' : 'user_display_name'
};

var wmcs = new WMCSEngine(options);
```

The JS SDK base class used to initialize the connection to the Multichannel System and perform voice and chat.
